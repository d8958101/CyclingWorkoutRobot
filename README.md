# CyclingWorkoutRobot
This is a robot to help cyclists automatically create cycling workouts(power based) on garmin connect website. 
Then you can sync these workouts to your garmin edge head unit and start your training. 
Any edge head unit later than 520(ex:edge 520 plus, edge 820, edge 1030...) supports power based cycling workouts.

## Basic usage
1. click "example workout file" button to download sample workout file.
2. click "select workout file" button then select sample file we just downloaded in step 1.
3. click "upload" button then garmin connect website page will pop up.
4. input your garmin id/password, done.

Example workout is a zone1(active recovery) => zone3(tempo) => zone2(endurance) => zone3(tempo) session.
You can customize your own workout using Microsoft office or notepad or... to modify the example workout to satisfy your needs.

The code of this robot is open source, and everyone can see what's inside. So your id/password won't be stolen by robot. 
Happy cycling happy training:D
